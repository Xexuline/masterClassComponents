# Super workshop of Components

 This project is a set of stroybooks which discover all the posibilities that we have in the Angular componets. Each storybook explore the posibilities of one of the 19 attributes that we can configure when we are coding Angular components. 

 The main idea of the workshop is to create work groups of around 6 people. The groups review all the storybooks and check the behavior of the components that is showed there. Each storybook has a set of question that the group should try to answer in order to understand what is happening in the storybook

## Start the workshop

1- Clone the repository in your local
2- Install the dependencies with the command 'npm i'
3- Start the storybook with the command 'npm start'
4- Access at the storybook with the URL: 'http://localhost:6006'

## Contribute at the project

Within the stories folder there is a directory with the name of one of the configuration attributes that are available in Angular Component. These directories should contain a storybook for each of the relevant use cases that the attribute with the same name of the folder provides in a component.

If you want to contribute to this project, you just have to make an pull request with a story book from one of the empty folders.

You can follow the example of the encapsulation storybooks.
